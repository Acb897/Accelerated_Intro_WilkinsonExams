    "The function \"*ls*\" lists information about the contents of the current directory (for example, text files (.txt) or folders). As most functions, ls has some options that allow the user to modify the output called arguments. In this problem, I used the \"*-lh*\" arguments. The meaning of each is explained as follows:\n",
    "* *-l*: tells the ls function to output a long listing format, which includes more detailed information about each file. This information includes the permissions, ownership, size, last edition date and the name of the file, in that order.\n",
    "* *-h*: tells the ls function to output the size of each file in a human-friendly manner (i.e., instead of displaying the file size as the plain number of bytes it occupies (for example, the Exam Week 1.ipynb's size would appear as 5569 without this argument), it displays the number of Kilo-, Mega-, etc... bytes (whichever is applicable) (the previous example would therefore be displayed as 5.5K).\n",

The letters themselves represent a specific permission. So *\"r\"* means reading permission, *\"w\"* means writing permission and *\"x\"* means executing permission.\n",

Since it is not very clear if we should only search for the literal world \"root\" or any of its derivatives, I tried to be logical about it and thought that if you were looking for phenotypes of plants with affected roots, you would have to search for root and roots, maybe even rooted (but there are no instances of that last word in the document, so it is not necessary).\n",

I also noticed the presence of some formatting errors, like the one happening in AT1G26630: the PubMed ID is on a different line, instead of in the same lane as the germplasm they refer to.
