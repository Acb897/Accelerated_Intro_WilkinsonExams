    "### Problem 1 answer:\n",
    "Even though this answer's code could produce a shorter output, I opted for this extended version because it serves as a check that this script is doing what it's supposed to be doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "I used the csv library to handle the input files (\"LocusGene.tsv\" and \"Germplasm.tsv\") because of it's usefulness and how easy it is to use. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first two variables I declared (\"tmp\" and \"mismatch\") are used to create the output. The former serves as a counter of the line that is being checked in each iteration of the loops and the latter serves as a counter of the times two lines are not the same in both documents. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I opened the files previously mentioned. As adding information to them isn't necessary, I opened them in read mode (the *\"r\"* part of the open call makes the files open in this mode). Note that I didn't close the connection to the files yet. This is because I still needed to make more operations on them in another problem's answer. \n",
    "Then, using the csv.DictReader function I loaded the data from both files to their respective functions (\"locus_data\" and \"germplasm_data\". Since these are \".tsv\" files, the delimiter is set to \"\\t\". Even though there are no quotation marks in the documents, I set it to double quotation marks (\") just in case in the future I wanted to use them. \n",
    "\n",
    "As the way the nested loops work is quite counter-intuitive, I will explain it in detail:\n",
    "Normally, when a for loop is nested into another, the resulting behaviour is that for each iteration of the first loop, the entirety of the nested loop is ran. In this particular situation, that means that the nested loops would cause the first line of the \"LocusGene.tsv\" file to be compared to **every** single line in the \"Germplasm.tsv\" document. But as the output shows, that's not what is happening. There are two reasons for this:\n",
    "* After all the code in the nested loop, I inserted a *\"break\"*. This means that instead of running this loop completely, only one iteration is actually run. That is because \"break\" causes the current loop to be terminated, and resumes execution at the next statement, which in this case is the next iteration of the first loop (the one that is not nested). \n",
    "* Ok, so for now the loops have compared the first line in the \"LocusGene.tsv\" and \"Germplasm.tsv\" files and the nested loop has been terminated, so now what should happen is that the second line of the LocusGene file should be compared with the **first** line on the Germplasm file again. But again, the output shows something different: the second line of both files is being compared. This is because I am reading from a file! When a for loop reads a line from either file, said file's pointer is set to the end of that line. This means that after reading one line, that line is no longer \"visible\" for the DictReader. The result of this interaction is that after comparing the fist line of both documents, and terminating the nested loop, the first loop reads the following line, which is the second one because of where the pointer is! Then, the second loop reads the \"first\" line in the Germplasm file, but since the pointer is at the end of the first line, the second line is what is really read. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is pretty hard to explain, so I will try to summarize:\n",
    "The for loop nested structure in my code works because when the files are read, the file pointer is set to the end of the last line read. With each iteration of the loops, the next lines are read and the pointer is subsecuentially placed on the end of those lines. Also, since I introduced a \"break\" in the nested loop, only one iteration is run, resulting in the designed behaviour consisting of comparing the first line in the LocusGene file with the first line in the Germplasm file, the second with the second and so on. \n",
    "Just to prove my explanation, I created a copy of this code in another code cell, but I commented out the \"break\" part. Check it's explanation please.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for what the loops do themselves, they simply print a string stating the line number that is being compared, show the comparison *per se* and showing the result of the comparinsons thanks to the if/else block. When I say that the lines from both documents are being compared, I mean that the \"Locus\" column from both documents is being compared. This is done in the *\" if row1[\"Locus\"] == row2[\"Locus\"]\"* line. Since the DictReader function outputs a variant of a dictionary created from separating each column of the document. The keys are the header line's text for each column (if present, otherwise they can be declared in the DictReader statement) and the values are well, the values of each row corresponding to each column (in this case, for example, the first element of the dictionary would be {\"Locus\" : \"AT1G01040\"}, the second {\"Gene\" : \"DCL1\"} and so on until the first line is recorded. Then the loop would iterate over the second line and fill in the values in that row). If the lines are not the same, the \"mismatch\" counter is incremented. At the end of each iteration the \"tmp\" counter increments as well to show the next lines to be checked. The \"tmp\" function is set to 1 at the beginning because even though technically the first lines to be compared are number 0 (at least in Python), it is easier for a human to understand if the count begins in 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the final results are created. If the \"mismatch\" variable's value is 0, that means that all comparisons showed that the lines were the same, so both documents are in the same order. "
